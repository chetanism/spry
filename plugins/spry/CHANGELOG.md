# spry changelog

Read by `/spry:update`. One entry per change a project may want; newest **last**. IDs are never
reused. A project's `spry_baseline` in `spry/spry.config.json` is the last entry it has considered.

Entry format:

- `## CH-<n> · <title>`
- **Date** · **Version** — the plugin version that carries it.
- **Touches** — plugin paths: `process/…`, `tool/spry.py`, `skills/…`, `stacks/…`.
- **Why** — the failure or gap it answers.
- **Adapt** — what a project chooses when taking it, or `nothing`.
- **Migrate** — what existing documents need, or `nothing`.

- **Date:** 2026-10-08 · **Version:** 0.1.0
